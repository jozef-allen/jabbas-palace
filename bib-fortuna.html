            <p id="bio-desc-p-one">Bib Fortuna was a male Twi'lek who lived on the desert planet Tatooine. He served as
              <a href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/jabba.html">Jabba the Hutt</a>'s majordomo and chief of staff
              for decades, handling all day-to-day operations at the
              palace.
            </p>
            <h2 class="bio-h2">Early years</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">Fortuna was born to a prominent Twi'lek clan that had close ties to the criminal
              underworld, though his more
              politically minded cousin, Beezer resented his family's associations. Before coming into the service of
              Hutt crime lord, Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Fortuna worked as a slave trader, one who was focused on members
              of
              his own species. He became rich from selling his fellow Twi'leks into slavery. </p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">At some point, Fortuna
              came into Jabba's service and competed against Bidlo Kwerve to become the Hutt's majordomo. Fortuna
              also gave Jabba his pet rancor, <a href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/pateesa.html">Pateesa</a> as a
              birthday present. Ultimately, Fortuna succeeded
              and claimed the job, whereas Kwerve ended up as an early victim of the rancor.
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              Fortuna served as Jabba's majordomo as far back as the time of the Invasion of Naboo, in 32 BBY. That
              year, Fortuna attended the Boonta Eve Classic, which his master hosted to commemorate the Boonta
              Eve holiday. From his master's private balcony, he witnessed the victory of a local human boy named
              Anakin Skywalker against the reigning champion, Sebulba.</p>
            <h2 class="bio-h2">Imperial Era</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">In the Imperial Era, Jabba welcomed two new smugglers into his employ, the Corellian
              human, Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca. As the Hutt's majordomo, Fortuna often found himself
              dealing with the pair, handing them assignments from Jabba and delineating their pay.</p>


            <h2 class="bio-h2">Galactic Civil War</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">Bounty hunter, <a href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/boba-fett.html">Boba
                Fett</a> would later on deliver Han Solo, imprisoned in carbonite to
              Jabba. Solo had fallen out of favour with the Hutt and would now be used as decoration in his throne room.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">In 4 ABY, Fortuna greeted two droid visitors to his master's palace. The two
              mechanical units, called C-3PO and R2-D2, claimed that they had a gift for the Hutt. The majordomo
              demanded that they hand over that gift to him so he could bring it to Jabba himself, but the droids
              answered that their instructions were to give it only to the crime lord himself. Fortuna relented, and led
              the droids into the throne room, where they delivered a holographic message from their owner, the Rebel
              hero and fledgling Jedi, Luke Skywalker. In the message, Skywalker asked to bargain for the life of his
              friend Han Solo, offering C-3PO and R2-D2 in exchange.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              Fortuna was present when Princess Leia Organa arrived under the disguise of notorious bounty hunter,
              <a href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/boushh.html">Boushh</a>
              along with a chained Chewbacca, demanding a higher payment for the Wookiee's capture, under the threat of
              a thermal detonator. He also witnessed Organa's capture when she attempted to free Solo herself. When Luke
              Skywalker eventually arrived, Fortuna admitted him into the throne room, despite having been given
              explicit instructions not to do so until after Jabba had finished his nap. Fortuna was influenced by
              Skywalker's mind trick (though he was not as weak-minded as some of Jabba's other guards). Skywalker only
              succeeded in his mind trick by finding and exploiting Fortuna's weak point, his strong loyalty to his
              master, Jabba.
            </p>
            <h2 class="bio-h2">Jabba's death</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">After Skywalker killed Jabba's Rancor, he was imprisoned and sentenced to death, with
              Jabba wanting him executed at the Great Pit of Carkoon. Fortuna accompanied Jabba and many of his palace
              denizens to the pit. Skywalker, Organa, Solo, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian managed to escape
              custody, kill Jabba, and destroy his personal sail barge. Though he was presumed to have died in the
              explosion, Fortuna survived the battle.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">By around 9 ABY, Fortuna had gained control of Jabba's palace, having amassed
              servants and slaves of his own, and become an obese crime lord. After the second rescue of Grogu,
              Boba Fett and Fennec Shand arrived at the palace, killed Fortuna's guards and released a slave. Fortuna
              greeted Fett and said he believed the bounty hunter had died, and that he had heard many rumors regarding
              him. Fett immediately shot Fortuna, killing him and assuming Fortuna's throne in the palace.</p>
