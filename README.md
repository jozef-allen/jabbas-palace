# Jabba's Palace 

* Jabba's Palace is a Star Wars-themed website that I created while teaching myself HTML and CSS.
* It contains details on the building as well as its inhabitants, sourcing facts and stories from various Star Wars media across the decades.
* You can see the site live at https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/
