          <div class="bio-desc-div">
            <p id="bio-desc-p-one">Droopy McCool, once known by the alias Snit, was a Kitonak member of the Max Rebo
              Band. McCool's true name was a series of whistles which was incomprehensible to most non-Kitonaks.</p>
            <h2 class="bio-h2">First band</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">It is unclear how Droopy left Kirdo III, but he reached Orvax IV with a slaver
              company. A melancholic Kitonak, he longed for the companionship of others of his species. It was on Orvax
              IV that Droopy, under the name Snit, was bought by Evar Orbus. Orbus was the lead voice of a music group,
              Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers, also featuring <a
                href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/max-rebo.html">Max Rebo</a> and <a
                href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/sy-snootles.html">Sy Snootles</a>.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              Snootles was fond of Snit. Due to the Kitonak's natural patience, Snit could listen to the singer's
              complaints and thoughts for hours without saying a word, and then he would gently soothe her pains and
              fears. Snootles believed that it was Snit who kept the group together.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">Orbus got a contract with Chalmun to play music in his cantina, on Tatooine. He led
              the group to Tatooine, but they were met by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, and a fight broke out between
              the two bands. Orbus confronted the attackers and died in the attempt, while the rest of the group ran
              away.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              Soon after Snit declared that he was unsatisfied with his name and wanted a stage name. Snootles wanted to
              help him,
              until Snit chose a new name in Kitonese that even her vocal apparatus could not reproduce. She convinced
              him to accept the stage name she made up, 'Droopy McCool.' His stage name was fitting, referring to his
              'cool' personality.</p>
            <h2 class="bio-h2">Max Rebo Band</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">The group was re-named the Max Rebo Band, now under Rebo's wing. This new
              incarnation was discovered by <a href="https://jabbaspalace.ptesquad.com/jabba.html">Jabba Desilijic
                Tiure</a>'s talent scout who got them an audition with Jabba
              himself. Jabba was impressed with the Rebo Band and offered Rebo a life contract in exchange for all the
              food they could eat. Rebo accepted before Snootles could stop him. Droopy did not have a chance to say
              anything either, but he considered that it was a bad deal; he ate once a month and they had a load of
              chooba slugs.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              During their first night at Jabba's Palace, a Gamorrean guard noticed that McCool was a Kitonak and
              mentioned that he had seen other Kitonaks on the Dune Sea. He left before Droopy said anything, but this
              idle chat gave him something to think about.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">Droopy went with the Rebo Band on Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon, and
              soon a large fight developed between Jabba's thugs and his victims. It was during this battle that Jabba
              died,
              technically ending the Rebo Band contract. McCool and Snootles
              jumped from the barge and Rebo was pushed.</p>
            <h2 class="bio-h2">Post Jabba</h2>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              They were recovering in the sand, where Snootles explained that she had a contract with Lady Valarian in
              mind. However, Droopy was uninterested. He was said to be hearing 'his brothers', other Kitonaks on the
              Dune Sea. Rebo heard nothing and was skeptical about that, but could not convince Snit. The Kitonak left
              for the desert to not be seen again.</p>
            <p class="bio-desc-p">
              Years later, some old moisture farmers said that they had heard chindinkalu flutes during the night, in
              the darkest corners of the desert, and others believed that it may have been Droopy and his pals playing
              music while waiting for the Cosmic Egg.</p>
